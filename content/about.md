I'm <span class="illuminate">Dr. Rohan French</span>. 
I did my PhD at Monash University in Australia under watchful eyes
of Lloyd Humberstone, working on translations between modal logics. 

From 2013-2014 I worked with Greg Restall and Jen Davoren on turning the University of
Melbourne's undergraduate logic course into a MOOC on Coursera, resulting in 
<a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/logic1">Logic: Language and Information 1</a> and 
<a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/logic2">Logic: Language and Information 2</a>.
One day I'll probably put some of the Python programs I developed to put together
the continuous assessment for the subject online here. 

Currently I'm in the Netherlands where I'm working with Associate Professor Catarina Dutilh Novaes
on the <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/therootsofdeduction/">Roots of Deduction</a> project at the University of Groningen, where I'm working on connections between proof-theory and dialogue games. 


My research is focused on issues in _philosophical logic_ and the _philosophy of logic_. I'm 
particularly interested in issues concerning philosophical proof-theory (esp. proof-theory
for weak quantificational logics, modal logics and varieties of inferentialism), modal logic 
(esp. first- and higher-order modal logics, and issues involving expressive power), 
translations between logics, and issues involving substructural logics. I'm generally interested in
any area of philosophy where formal methods can be fruitfully applied.

When I'm not doing research I usually spend my time reading science-fiction and fantasy
novels, listening to music and playing computer games. 

I drink _a lot_ of coffee (I recomend <a href="http://blackandbloom.nl/">Black &amp; Bloom</a> if you're in Groningen, and <a href="http://marketlane.com.au/">Market Lane Coffee</a> if you're in Melbourne).
