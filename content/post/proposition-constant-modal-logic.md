Consider the normal modal logic determined by the frame $\mathfrak{F} = \langle W, R, C\rangle$,
where $W = \\{0, 1\\}$, $R = \\{\langle 0,1\rangle, \langle 1, 0\rangle\\}$ and $C = \\{0\\}$ where
we use the set $C$ to interpret our propositional constant $\kappa$ (so $\kappa$ is true at a point
in a model just in case that point is in the set $C$).
