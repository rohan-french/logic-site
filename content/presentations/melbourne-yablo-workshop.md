In this talk I show how various desirable formal features of partial content and logical
subtraction are sensitive to whether we understand them in terms of _recursive_ truthmakers (as favoured
by Fine and van Frassen) or _reductive_ truthmakers (which Yablo prefers). In particular if we think of 
partial content in terms of _reductive_ truthmakers (which when dealing with propositional languages correspond
to the minimal partial valuations generated by the prime implicants of a formula) then both partial content and
logical subtraction fail to be closed under uniform substitution. When characterised in terms of recursive truthmakers
both of these notions are closed under uniform substitution. Prima facie, this suggests that if we want to think of either
of these notions as holding in virtue of logical form, then we had best understand them in terms of recursive truthmakers.
