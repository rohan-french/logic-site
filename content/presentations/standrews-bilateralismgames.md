Description = "Workshop on Inferentialism, University of St Andrews"

<p>According to <em>bilateralists</em> we can think of logic as involving constraints on assertion and denial: a sequent $X\vdash Y$ being
valid whenever asserting all the sentences in $X$ and denying all the sentences in $Y$ invovles a clash. This account raises
two immediate questions: assertion and denial are social acts involving multiple agents, but barely a single agent is present in bilateralist accounts (them mostly involving `assertion in the void&rsquo;); and secondly we need to know what is involved in a package
of assertions and denials involving a clash. I address both of these problems by looking at odd dialogue games intended to model
cooperative explorations of conversational positions.</p>
