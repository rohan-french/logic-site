<p>According to the logical pluralist, there may be more than one legitimate answer to the question of whether a given deductive argument is valid. The pluralist faces a challenge, though, to explain how this could be so. In this paper I show that by adopting the &lsquo;built-in opponent&rsquo; conception of deduction, a specific multi-agent dialogical account of our deductive practices, we can address the explanatory challenge: the different logics arise out of different norms effecting our argumentative and explanatory practices. In order to clarify our position we introduce Prover-Skeptic games, a novel kind of dialogue game introduced by SÃ¸rensen &amp; Urzyczyn. Unlike traditional Lorenzen and Hintikka style dialogue games, theses are games of &lsquo;proof-construction&rsquo; as opposed to &lsquo;formula-evaluation&rsquo;, and thus they connect up better with the built-in opponent view of our deductive practices. We give a uniform adequacy result for a class of substructural implicational logics relative to Prover-Skeptic games, with the changes in the structural rules in play being reflected in a uniform manner in the dialogue game.</p>
