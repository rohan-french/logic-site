<p>That one can deal with the semantic paradoxes by restricting or rejecting structural rules is
now relatively well known. In particular, solutions which reject the structural rule of cut and
contraction are currently en vogue. What has not been seriously considered are the prospects
of dealing with the paradoxes by rejecting the ur-structural rule of reflexivity—for all
formulas $A$: $A \vdash A$. Here we will show that the non-reflexive approach to the semantic
paradoxes bears further investigation. In particular we will show that a fully non-reflexive
approach can capture much of what is desirable about classical reasoning.</p>
