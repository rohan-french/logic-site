<p>It is well known that the most straightforward way of adding rules for the quantifiers to
any adequate sequent calculus for the modal logic <strong>S5</strong> allows for the derivation of the
Barcan formula&mdash;$\diamondsuit\exists x\varphi \to \exists x \diamondsuit\varphi$. This
result is philosophically undesirable as, contra the Barcan Formula,  common-sense metaphysics would have it that things can possibly exist without actually existing. In this talk I give an
account of what is suspicious about such derivations by making use of a modal object
language with primitive scope indicators. Using this modal object language we see derivations of
the Barcan formula as requiring a certain kind of scope elision between &ldquo;possibly, $a$ is $F$&rdquo; (written in this
language as &ldquo;$\diamondsuit\ a\ Fa$&ldquo;) and &ldquo;concerning $a$, possibly it is $F$&rdquo; (written as &ldquo;$a\
\diamondsuit Fa$&ldquo;), where we are only able to infer &ldquo;$\exists x \diamondsuit Fx$&rdquo; from  the second
of these
formulas.</p>
