According to logical pluralists there may be more than one legitimate answer to the question of whether a given deductive argument is valid. 
Those who wish to defend a pluralist position face a kind of explanatory challenge: how can there be multiple correct notions of logical
consequence. In the present talk I will argue that adopting a multi-agent dialogical account of logical consequence allows quite directly
for an interesting form of logical pluralism. In order to clarify the position I introduce <em>Prover-Skeptic Games</em>, a novel kind of 
dialogue game (initially introduced by Sørensen &amp; Urzyczyn in the context of the lambda-calculus) which more closely resembles &lsquo;proof-construction&rsquo; rather than &lsquo;formula-evaluation&rsquo;. We then use these dialogue games to show how interest-relative
features of explanation result in an interest-relative form of logical pluralism.
